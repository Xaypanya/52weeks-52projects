This repository will serve as a personal tracker for my ambitious goal: building 52 projects in 52 weeks. Each week, I will develop a new project using a variety of modern tech stacks, with a focus on both front-end and back-end technologies. The goal is to gain deeper hands-on experience with frameworks, libraries, and databases while building useful, creative, or experimental projects.

Tech Stacks to Explore:
Frontend:
 - Next.js
 - Nuxt.js
Backend:
 - Node.js
 - Go
Databases:
 - SQL
 - PostgreSQL
 - MongoDB
